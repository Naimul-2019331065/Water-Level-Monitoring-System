# Water Level Monitoring System

![Project Image](link_to_project_image)

This project, developed for CSE 250 (Project II), introduces an innovative solution for monitoring liquid levels using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system is designed to alert users about potential issues such as liquid overflow or depletion in a tank. It incorporates an ultrasonic sensor to accurately measure the water level and percentage in the tank. The associated mobile application provides users with the ability to monitor and control the entire system, including the option to turn the water pump on or off. Additionally, different colored LED lights are employed to visually indicate the water level in the tank.

## Components Required

- **NodeMCU ESP8266**
- **5V Relay Module**
- **Wire**
- **3-6V Submersible Water Pump**
- **Tube**
- **Breadboard**
- **Ultrasonic Sonar Sensor HC-SR04**
- **5V Power Source**

## Project Goals

1. **Water Conservation:** Eliminate water wastage during the tank refilling process.
2. **Simplified Maintenance:** Reduce the hassle of regularly monitoring and maintaining the water level in the tank.

## Setup Instructions

1. Connect the Ultrasonic Sonar Sensor HC-SR04 to the NodeMCU ESP8266 using wires.
2. Connect the 5V Relay Module to the NodeMCU ESP8266 to control the submersible water pump.
3. Attach the submersible water pump to the water tank using a tube.
4. Set up the breadboard to organize the connections neatly.
5. Power the system with a 5V power source.
