#Water Level Monitoring System

This is the project code for CSE 250 (Project II). 
This system for monitoring liquid levels is based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which includes a mechanism for alerting users in case of liquid overflow or depletion of the tank. An ultrasonic sensor is attached to the water tank to measure the water level and percentage in the tank. The mobile application monitors and controls the entire system, including turning on and off the water pump. Additionally, different colored LED lights indicate the water level in the tank.

Required components:
•	NodeMCU ESP8266
•	5V Relay module 
•	Wire
•	3-6V Submersible water-pump
•	Wire
•	Tube
•	Breadboard
•	Ultrasonic SonarSensor HC-SR04
•	5V power source

Goal of this project:
1. To eliminate water wastage during refilling the tank.
2. To reduce the hassle of maintaining the water level of the tank time to time.
